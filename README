Welcome to JEdit - Text Editor for a Programmer 

***********************************************************************************************************************
ABOUT THE APPLICATION

This is a text editor for a programmer. It is developed as a Java Swing Application. 

It is a simple text editor that supports multiple document interface (MDI), whereby a user can work on several 
documents at the same time by opening several windows or tabs. It is possible to minimize and maximize each window in 
the app. There is a bar for line numbering on the left side of the window and a status line at the bottom of the user 
interface.

The application allows a user to Create a new file, Open an existing file, Save a file, Save As for a 
file, Close the selected tab from the tabbed pane, Exit or quit the program. 

In this application, programmer or user can also edit the plain text in the code area. User can Cut, Copy, Paste and 
Select All text. 

In addition to Edit, I have added formatting options to Bold, Italicize, Normalize the content of the code area. I have 
also included options to change the size, font type and color of the text document. 

I have used JTextArea component. It is more suited for editing program source code than JEditorPane, because it drops the 
unnecessary features (images, variable-width lines, and so on). It is also faster and doesn't have as many problems. It 
can be used in other applications.

Technology involved includes Java. The development environment is Eclipse Java EE IDE for Web Developers. Version: Helios 
Service Release 2. In addition to my own comments, the Javadoc comments are generated using JAutodoc 1.9.0. A plugin that 
can installed in Eclipse. The Javadoc document is generated using Javadoc in Eclipse
